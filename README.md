# Stock-Management-and-Analysis-Tool
Last OOD Assignment

This project focuses on enhancing user experience and usability in a beginner-friendly investment simulation application. To support user engagement and learning, the application includes convenient strategies for portfolio management and a clean, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Key features leverage API-driven stock analysis, enabling gain/loss calculation, x-day moving averages, and crossover detection for deeper insights. Users can create portfolios, assess values, and rebalance holdings with persistent save/retrieve functionality, including saving and retrieving data via XML documents for streamlined data management. The GUI includes bar chart visualizations to illustrate stock and portfolio performance over time, helping users understand investment trends and develop informed strategies.

** GUI is not completely operational as there is an issue with loading and retrieving a portfolio. **
